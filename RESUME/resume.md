## Experience
### Analytics Engineer & Data Analyst @ Side by Randstad (temp work app)
From July 2023 to July 2024, I operated as a Data Analyst with a focus on Analytics Engineering using dbt. I had the opportunity to create models (based on Kimball modelling), explore, transform, load, and analyse data to power product, sales, marketing, financial, and operation teams. Also, I was responsible for the development of custom dashboards allowing companies to monitor their temp work activity through Looker. 

- Delivered an in-app onboarding funnel: reduced by 35% the cost of verification of temp workers' documents.

- Delivered an anonymized temp work activity dashboard: acquired 2 new major clients.

- Performed Looker training sessions adapted to different technical levels: helped over 30 co-workers improve their skills and autonomy.

- Created and migrated SQL transformations into dbt: improved maintainability, testability and costs.
 
**Techs:** Looker, LookML, PostgreSQL, dbt, git, Airflow, Python, Zapier

### Data Analyst @ Girondins de Bordeaux (football club)
