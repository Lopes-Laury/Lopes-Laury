With a background in nanophysics chemistry, I ventured into data analysis during the pandemic. Recognizing its transformative potential, I have shifted my career trajectory and ventured into data analysis during the pandemic, after I took an ambitious bootcamp.enrolled in a ambitious bootcamp. Evolving in startup environments, I leverage my scientific background and analytical skills to drive innovation. Fueled by a passion for problem-solving, I'm committed to making a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving landscape of data science through continuous learning and dedication.

## Expertise
SQL, dbt, Looker, Power BI, Python

## Experiences
### Data Analyst @ SIDE by RANDSTAD (Temp work app)
Since July 2023, as Data Analyst in the BI team, I had the chance to perform deep analysis and insights: 
* **Conversion funnel analysis:** several friction points have been highlighted and product teams are testing different ways to streamline the process to gain up to 45% productivity and maximize profits;

* **Risk analysis:** built a key account risk analysis dashboard to help management and sales teams identify risks and grow the business (analysis of monthly revenue over several years, relative risk ratio based on potential and actual revenue, market share, churn rate, portfolio, etc.);

* **User segmentation analysis:** helped the product and marketing teams develop and innovate the product and campaigns by adapting solutions to B2C and B2B customers (gender, age, iOS/android, turnover, industry, etc.);

* **Looker trainee courses:** created a 3-level Looker class course to help teams navigate dashboards and looks, but also to help them improve their skills and be more independent.

**Techs:** Looker (lookML), PostgreSQL, Metabase, Airflow, dbt, git.

### Data Analyst @ FC Girondins de Bordeaux (Football club, ligue 1)
From Jan 2022 to June 2023, I operated as the first data analyst at the club. I worked closely with Sales, Ticketing, Marketing and Financial teams: 

* **Email marketing analysis:** built a communication strategy based on the statistical analysis of email marketing campaigns for each segment (number of openings, number of clicks, return on investment, etc.);

* **Power BI implementation:** created models in Power BI and built scripts for data preparation to track sales activity daily and weekly. This work allowed the sales manager to save one and a half day per week of working time;

* **Financial analysis:** helped the finance team develop revenue forecasts and analyzes to present the company to investors;

* **Sentiment analysis:** analyzed the comments using Google sentiment analysis and helped come up with different strategies to attract more people to the stadium.

**Techs:** Power BI, Jupyter Notebook, Python. 

### Scientific Writer @ GAC Group (Innovation consulting)
From Oct 2018 to Sept 2019, I worked as a scientific writer to build tax deduction official documents for innovating and scientifical projects. I worked for big companies, such as: safran, segula, OTIS, engie, etc. 

**Techs:** Microsoft suite.

### PhD student in Nanophysics @ CNRS (National scientific research center)
From Sept 2018 to Aug 2019, I worked as a PhD student to study the interactions of graphene and Indium molecules for molecular electronics with a RT-STM microscope.

**Techs:** Origin Lab, MatLab, LateX
