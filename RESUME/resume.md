With a background in science, I decided to take a turn on my career and ventured into data analysis
during the pandemic by taking a bootcamp. For the past almost 2,5 years, I have been leveraging
my scientific background and analytical skills to activate data and build end-to-end data tools such as dashboards to increase business productivity. Fueled by a passion for problem-solving and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, I am looking for a job
in London to grow both professionally and personally.
